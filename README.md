# threatseer <img align="right" src="docs/images/gopher.svg" width="25%">

Threatseer is a lightweight agent-based security telemetry solution for Linux.

### Try running threatseer [with Docker](docs/RUN_IT.md)

 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dustin-decker/threatseer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dustin-decker/threatseer)

## Features

### Agent features

The agent collects security telemetry which is offloaded to a server for behavioral analysis and the rest.

- event-driven structured data of important system events
  - container lifecycle
  - processes touching sensitive data
  - processes spawned and lifecycle events
  - network events
- low resource cost: typically less than ~1% of one CPU core, ~30MiB RAM
- ~5mb statically compiled binary deployable

### Server features

<img align="right" src="docs/images/global_coverage.svg" width="50%"/>

The server component uses several behavioral analysis engines for scoring events and has several JSON telemetry output methods available:

#### Behavioral Analysis Engines

- Profile - automatic execution behavior profile generated for container image or process lifecycle
- Static - risky processes, file/directory integrity monitoring (todo), known IOCs (todo)
- Dynamic - custom queries

#### Telemetry outputs

- Elasticsearch
- Kafka
- Logstash
- Redis
- File
- Stdout

## Example telemetry
